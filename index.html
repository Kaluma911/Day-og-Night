            <p>
              The blockout/mockup is like the first draft of our project. We use
              basic shapes and outlines to plan where things will go in our
              scene, like buildings, objects, and people. It helps us see if
              everything fits together the way we want before we add all the
              details. This stage is important because it lets us try out
              different ideas quickly and see what works best. We can move
              things around easily and make changes without getting stuck on
              small stuff. Even though the blockout/mockup looks simple, it's
              the starting point for making our scene look awesome. It helps us
              figure out the big picture and make sure everything makes sense
              before we add all the finishing touches.

            <h2 class="text-center">Clay Render</h2>
            <p>
              The clay render is like a model made of plain clay. It's a simple
              version of our scene without any colors or fancy details. We use
              it to focus on the shapes and forms of objects and characters. In
              the clay render, everything is the same color, like it's made of
              clay. This helps us see the overall shape and structure more
              clearly. We can check if everything looks right and if any
              adjustments are needed before we add all the colors and textures.
              Even though it's not as pretty as the final version, the clay
              render is really helpful. It lets us make sure everything looks
              good from all angles and that nothing is missing or out of place.

            <h2 class="text-center">Wireframe</h2>
            <p>
              Imagine our project as a skeleton. The wireframe is like the bones
              that support everything. It's a simple outline made of lines and
              shapes that show us where things are in our scene. We use it to
              plan the structure and layout before adding all the details. With
              the wireframe, we can see the basic shape of buildings, objects,
              and characters. It helps us understand how they fit together and
              move around. Think of it as a blueprint that guides us in building
              our scene step by step. Even though it looks basic, the wireframe
              is super important. It helps us make sure everything is in the
              right place and works well together before we add all the fancy
              colors and textures.
